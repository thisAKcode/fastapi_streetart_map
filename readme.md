### Usage

You can use that project to load your json data (points)  into postgresql db, and then render a simple map in browser, otherwise works as a crud api. Limitation is that your data has to match the json schema of sample data.

### API Documentation 

wich tools to use.
1. Frontend, leaflet, htmx.
2. Query db using fast api, sqlalchemy/SQLModel
3. htmx

Description of the API provided by the project will come as I work on that project, including details about the endpoints, request and response formats. Otherwise get a look at a docs generated by Swagger UI from my FastAPI code, that is pretty awesome.
